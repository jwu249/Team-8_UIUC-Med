Section 6 API Plan:
implemented function-based API endpoint at /api/services/ that reads query parameters from request.GET and filters our MedService records using Django ORM lookups (e.g., __icontains and boolean exact match).

Data Served:
API will returns non-sensitive MedService fields only: id, name, location, and appointments_required.
HttpResponse vs JsonResponse:
added /api/services-http/ to demonstrate HttpResponse output with text/plain MIME type, while /api/services/ uses JsonResponse with application/json MIME type for proper API behavior.
