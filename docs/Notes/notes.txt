2/14/26 A3 notes

Section 1 (URL linking/navigation):
Implemented get_absolute_url() on MedService so templates can link to detail pages without hard-coded URL patterns. This is useful because if route patterns change, links stay correct as long as get_absolute_url() is updated in one model method.

Section 3 (static files):
Static files are organized in a project-level static/ directory with static/css/base_styles.css and static/images/logo.png. Templates load files through {% load static %} and {% static %} so paths are framework-managed instead of manual relative paths.

Cache busting note (optional):
Current setup does not add hashed filenames yet. A future improvement is enabling ManifestStaticFilesStorage so deployed static assets are cache-busted automatically when content changes.

Section 6 (API):
Implemented a function-based API endpoint at /api/services/ that reads query parameters from request.GET and filters MedService records with ORM lookups. The API returns non-sensitive fields only (id, name, location, appointments_required). Added /api/services-http/ to demonstrate HttpResponse text/plain vs JsonResponse application/json MIME behavior.
